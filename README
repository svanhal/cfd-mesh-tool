CFD Mesh Tool.

"Treat your walls right."


- This tool estimates first cell height to get correct y+ value based on fluid type and flow properties.

- Calculation is available for:
	- Air and water flows.
	- Internal or external flows.

- Density and viscosity of the fluids are calculated for user-defined operating conditions (pressure and temperature).
	- This doesn't significantly affect the first cell height estimate.
	- Altough, it is useful for getting your basic fluid properties during case setup.

- Estimate of surface mesh element size is given to meet user-defined aspect ratio limit of the first cell.
	- Works for triangular and quad surface meshes.


Let me know if you have any questions about the tool or near wall treatment in CFD simulations in general.

This is my first C++ app. I will welcome any feedback and suggestions.
